Setting up a new computer:
* Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* Install [fish](https://fishshell.com/) - `brew install fish`
* Install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - `brew install fzf`
* [Add github SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

Other stuff:
* Map caps lock key to escape (System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard
  Shortcuts > Modifier Keys) â€” this happens on a per-keyboard basis
